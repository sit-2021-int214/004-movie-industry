# Assignment 3 (Group): Explore Data with dpylr
Rewrite your function by using dpylr at least 5 topics (from 2 datasets). Your group can add new topics to reach 5 topics.

### Prerequisite

1. If you don't have these packages, then install it first (But, if you already have these packages, you can skip this step)
```R
install.packages(c("MASS", "DescTools", "dplyr", "formattable"))
```

2. Load these packages (After loaded, you can run every R script below)
```R
packages <- c("DescTools", "MASS", "dplyr", "formattable")
lapply(packages, library, character.only = T)

# help(DescTools)
# help(MASS)
# help(dplyr)
# help(formattable)
```

3. (Optional) Check the total N/A in each data before do something :)
```R
# count N/A in each column of survey table
print(colSums(is.na(survey)))

# count N/A in each column of cats table
print(colSums(is.na(cats))) 
```

### Dataset: [survey](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MASS/versions/7.3-47/topics/survey)

1.) Based on the survey table, there are 10 male students who write with their left hand and 7 female students who do the same; 108 male students and 110 female students use their right hand to write.
```R
male_wHnd <- table(survey[survey$Sex == "Male", "W.Hnd"])
female_wHnd <- table(survey[survey$Sex == "Female", "W.Hnd"])
df_wHnd <- rbind(male_wHnd, female_wHnd)

df_wHnd <- as.data.frame(df_wHnd) # table -> data frame

row.names(df_wHnd) <- c("male", "female")

# View(df_wHnd)
print(df_wHnd)

# Using dplyr
df_wHnd_dplyr <- survey %>%
    dplyr::select(Sex, W.Hnd) %>%
    group_by(Sex) %>%
    filter(Sex == "Male" | Sex == "Female", W.Hnd == "Left" | W.Hnd == "Right") %>%
    count(W.Hnd) %>%
    dplyr::rename(amount = n)
print(df_wHnd_dplyr)
```

2.) Based on the survey table, 7.23% of students write with their left hand while 92.77% write with their right hand.
```R
total <- colSums(df_wHnd) # "df_wHnd" from item 1
total_percentage <- round((total/sum(total)) * 100, digits = 2)
names(total_percentage) <- c("Left(%)", "Right(%)")

print(total_percentage)

# Using dplyr
df_total_pct <- survey %>%
    dplyr::select(W.Hnd, Sex) %>%
    filter(!is.na(W.Hnd), !is.na(Sex)) %>%
    group_by(W.Hnd) %>%
    dplyr::rename(hand = W.Hnd) %>%
    summarise(amount = sum(!is.na(hand))) %>%
    mutate(amount = formattable::percent(amount/sum(amount))) %>%
    dplyr::rename(pct = amount)
print(df_total_pct)
```

3.) From the survey table, the number of people in each gender
```R
print(table(survey$Sex))

# Using dplyr
# code here
```

4.) From the survey table, the frequency percentage of students who smoke
```R
smoke_df <- as.data.frame(table(survey$Smoke))
colnames(smoke_df) <- c("freq", "percentage")
smoke_df <- smoke_df[order(factor(smoke_df$freq, levels = c("Never", "Occas", "Regul", "Heavy"))), ]
row.names(smoke_df) <- c(1:length(smoke_df$freq))

percentage <- round((smoke_df$percentage/sum(smoke_df$percentage)) * 100, digits = 3)
smoke_df$percentage <- percentage

# View(smoke_df)
print(smoke_df)

# Using dplyr
# code here
```

5.) Based on the survey table, the average Wr.Hand (span of writing hand, in cm) of females is 17.6

```R
wrF <- mean(survey$Wr.Hnd[which(survey$Sex == "Female")])
mean_WrF <- round(wrF, digits = 2)
cat("Average span of female writing hand, in cm:",mean_WrF)

# Using dplyr
survey %>% filter(Sex == "Female") %>% summarise(Sex = "Female" , Avg_Wr.Hnd = round(mean(Wr.Hnd), digit =2))
```

### Dataset: [cats](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MASS/versions/7.3-47/topics/cats)

1.) Based on the cats table, max heart weight of a male cat is 20.5g while female cat is 13g.
    min heart weight of a male cat is 6.5g while female cat is 6.3g.
```R
maxCatM <- max(cats[cats$Sex == 'M',"Hwt"])
maxCatF <- max(cats[cats$Sex == 'F',"Hwt"])
minCatM <- min(cats[cats$Sex == 'M',"Hwt"])
minCatF <- min(cats[cats$Sex == 'F',"Hwt"])

maxHW <- c(maxCatM,maxCatF)
minHW <- c(minCatM,minCatF)

catHW <- cbind(maxHW,minHW)
row.names(catHW) <- c("Male","Female")
catHW <- as.data.frame(catHW)

# View(catHW)
print(catHW)

# Using dplyr
df_catHW <- cats %>%
  dplyr::select(Sex,Hwt) %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  filter(Sex == "F" | Sex == "M") %>%
  summarise(maxHWT = max(Hwt),minHWT = min(Hwt))
print(df_catHW)
```

2.) Based on the cats table, 67.36% of cats is male while 32.64% is female.
```R
allMaleCat <- table(cats[cats$Sex == "M", "Sex"])
allFemaleCat <- table(cats[cats$Sex == "F", "Sex"])
allCat <- rbind(allMaleCat,allFemaleCat)

allCat <- colSums(allCat)

totalCatPercent <- round((allCat/sum(allCat)) * 100, digits = 2 )
names(totalCatPercent) <- c("Female%", "Male%")
totalCatPercent <- sort(totalCatPercent, decreasing = T)

print(totalCatPercent)

# Using dplyr
df_totalCatPercent <- cats %>%
  dplyr::select(Sex) %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  filter(Sex == "F" | Sex == "M") %>%
  summarise(pct = n()) %>%
  mutate(pct = formattable::percent(pct/sum(pct)))
print(df_totalCatPercent)
```

3.) Based on the cats table, the average body weight of male cats is 2.9 and average body weight of female cats is 2.36
```R
avg_bwtm <- round(mean(cats[cats$Sex == "M" , "Bwt"]), digits = 2)
avg_bwtf <- round(mean(cats[cats$Sex == "F" , "Bwt"]), digits = 2)
cat("Average Bwt of Male cats : ", avg_bwtm ,"\n")
cat("Average Bwt of Female cats : ", avg_bwtf)

# Using dplyr
cats %>% filter(Sex == "M") %>% summarise(Sex = "Male", Bwt = mean(Bwt)) 
cats %>% filter(Sex == "F") %>% summarise(Sex = "Female" , Bwt = round(mean(Bwt), digits = 2))
```

4.) From the cats table, the average of female cat heart weight in grams
```R
avg_hwt_f <- mean(cats[cats$Sex == "F", "Hwt"])
print(avg_hwt_f)

# Using dplyr
# code here
```

5.) From the cats table, the total weight of female and male cats in kilograms
```R
sum_bwt_female <- sum(cats[cats$Sex == "F", "Bwt"])
sum_bwt_male <- sum(cats[cats$Sex == "M", "Bwt"])
df_sum_bwt <- data.frame(sum_bwt_female, sum_bwt_male)

row.names(df_sum_bwt) <- "total weight"
colnames(df_sum_bwt) <- c("female cats", "male cats")

# View(df_sum_bwt)
print(df_sum_bwt)

# Using dplyr
# code here
```
