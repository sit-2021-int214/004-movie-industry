### My Step
1. Define a question
2. Loading Library and dataset
3. Cleaning dataset
4. find Answers.

## Define a question

1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
2. Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
4. What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
6. Which school is get highest SAT score ?

Can add more question ....

## Step 0: Loading library and dataset

```
# Library
library(name)

# Dataset
dataset <- read_csv("")
```

## 1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
      -How many observation before cleaning ?
      -List variable name
```
sat_score %>% str()
```

Result: there are 485 observation in this dataset. Variables are DBN , school_name , math_score , reading_score and writing_score

```
'data.frame':	485 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ DBN          : chr  "01M292" "01M448" "01M450" "01M458" ...
 $ school_name  : chr  "HENRY STREET SCHOOL FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES" "UNIVERSITY NEIGHBORHOOD HIGH SCHOOL" "EAST SIDE COMMUNITY SCHOOL" "FORSYTH SATELLITE ACADEMY" ...

 $ reading_score: chr  "355" "383" "377" "414" ...
 $ writing_score: chr  "363" "366" "370" "359" ...
```

## 1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
