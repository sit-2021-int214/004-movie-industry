### Import nesessary packages
```{r import-packages}
packages <- c("dplyr", "readr", "scales")
lapply(packages, library, character.only = T)
```

### Import dataset
```{r import-dataset}
movies <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sit-2021-int214/004-movie-industry/main/movie_industry/csv/cleaned_dataset/movies_cleaned.csv")
```

### Check data types each variable
```{r observe-data}
# observe dataset and data type
glimpse(movies)
```

### Convert an inappropriate data type
```{r convert-datatype}
# convert data type
movies <- movies %>%
    mutate(year = format(year, format = "%Y")) %>%
    mutate(released.country = as.factor(released.country)) %>%
    mutate_at(.vars = c("genre", "rating", "country"), .funs = as.factor) %>%
    mutate_at(.vars = c("votes", "runtime"), .funs = as.integer)
glimpse(movies)
```

### Check N/A
```{r check-na}
# check N/A
na_col <- colSums(is.na(movies))
na_col[na_col > 0]
```
